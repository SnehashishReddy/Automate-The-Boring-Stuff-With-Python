# Date Detection

# Write a regular expression that can detect dates in the DD/MM/YYYY format.
# Assume that the days range from 01 to 31, the months range from 01 to 12, and 
# the years range from 1000 to 2999. Note that if the day or month is a single digit, 
# itâ€™ll have a leading zero.

# The regular expression doesnâ€™t have to detect correct days for each month or for leap years; 
# it will accept nonexistent dates like 31/02/2020 or 31/04/2021. Then store these strings into 
# variables named month, day, and year, and write additional code that can detect if it is a valid date. 
# April, June, September, and November have 30 days, February has 28 days, and the rest of the months 
# have 31 days. February has 29 days in leap years. Leap years are every year evenly divisible by 4, 
# except for years evenly divisible by 100, unless the year is also evenly divisible by 400. 
# Note how this calculation makes it impossible to make a reasonably sized regular expression that 
# can detect a valid date.
